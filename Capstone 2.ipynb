    "Due to the COVID-19 disruptions, hospitals generally have reduced capacity to treat victims of car accidents.  Although some countries, particularly European, have instituted lockdowns, this is not the case for the US. Commuter levels are therefore the same as they were in March 2020 pre-COVID, and therefore accident rates are likely the same ceteris paribus. \n",

    "This will serve as forewarning for hospitals to prepare measures to treat these victims, instead of expending resources for less-common injuries/accieents. Additionally, this model will alert state/federal governments to time periods where accidents are more likely, allowing them to respond more effectively. "
